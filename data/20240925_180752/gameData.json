            "satirical_column": "In a move that can only be described as the academic equivalent of waterboarding, Peter Mandelson - the Dark Lord of New Labour and walking advertisement for the dangers of political necromancy - has suggested raising tuition fees to ease pressure on English universities. Because nothing says \"pressure relief\" quite like squeezing the last drops of financial hope from the already desiccated corpses of student bank accounts.\n\nMandelson, a man so slippery he makes eels look like they're covered in velcro, argues that increasing fees from \u00a39,250 to \u00a39,480 would provide \"stability.\" Ah yes, the stability of knowing you'll be in debt until the heat death of the universe. It's the kind of reassurance that makes you want to trade your degree for a handful of magic beans and a tin foil hat.\n\nBut wait, there's more! In a display of generosity that would make Ebenezer Scrooge blush, Mandelson suggests capping future increases at 2.5% annually. How thoughtful. At this rate, by 2050, students will be able to fund their education by simply selling a kidney, half their liver, and their firstborn child to the university bookshop.\n\nThe Labour peer, who's running to be Oxford University's next chancellor (because apparently, the position of \"Grand Inquisitor of Student Suffering\" was already filled), also proposes a more \"progressive\" loan repayment system. Under this scheme, graduates would start repaying at 2% of their income, increasing by 2 percentage points for each additional \u00a310,000 earned. It's like a fun game of financial Jenga, where each block you pull out represents another slice of your soul being consumed by the insatiable maw of capitalism.\n\nMandelson claims this would be \"particularly beneficial for women.\" Yes, ladies, rejoice! Now you can pursue your dreams of nursing or teaching, secure in the knowledge that your comparatively low salaries will ensure you're trapped in a cycle of debt repayment until the end of time. It's feminism in action, folks!\n\nBut let's not forget the real victims here: the universities themselves. With only one teaching staff for every 13 students (compared to Italy's luxurious 1:21 ratio), how can we expect these bastions of learning to survive? Perhaps we could introduce a \"Hunger Games\" style competition for faculty positions. Last professor standing gets tenure and a slightly less soul-crushing workload.\n\nIn a final stroke of genius, Mandelson suggests focusing research on a smaller range of technologies as part of a national industrial strategy. Because nothing says \"innovation\" quite like putting all your eggs in one basket and hoping it doesn't get dropped off a cliff.\n\nSo there you have it, folks. Peter Mandelson's recipe for higher education success: raise fees, increase debt, narrow research focus, and pray to the ghost of Margaret Thatcher that it all somehow works out. It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.\n\nIn the meantime, I suggest students start practicing their street performance skills. After all, when you're living in a cardboard box under a bridge, busking might be your only hope of ever paying off those loans. But hey, at least you'll have that degree in 14th-century Flemish poetry to keep you warm at night.",

And what a glorious fever dream it is!\n\nPicture, if you will, a world where the solution to cash-strapped universities is not to, oh I don't know, adequately fund them, but instead to gently squeeze students for an extra \u00a3230 a year. It's like watching a magician pull not a rabbit from a hat, but a slightly larger hat from a slightly smaller hat. Bravo, Peter! Your sleight of hand is truly masterful.\n\nBut wait, there's more! In this hallucinogenic haze of higher education policy, Mandelson proposes a system where repayments start at a mere 2% of a graduate's income. How generous! It's as if he's taken a page from the 'Monopoly: Millennial Edition' rulebook, where landing on Park Lane means you have to forfeit your avocado toast for a month.\n\nAnd let's not forget the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: a progressive loan system that increases by 2 percentage points for each additional \u00a310,000 earned, up to a maximum of 8%. It's like a game of Snake and Ladders, but instead of snakes, you have crushing debt, and instead of ladders, you have... well, more crushing debt, but with a fancy bow on top.\n\nOne can't help but wonder if Mandelson has been spending too much time in Oxford's Botanic Garden, mistaking some of the more exotic specimens for a light afternoon snack. How else to explain the psychedelic logic of suggesting that Italian universities, with their 1:21 staff-to-student ratio, are a model of efficiency to aspire to? Mamma mia! Next, we'll be told that the solution to NHS waiting times is to adopt the queueing system of the Roman Colosseum.\n\nBut fear not, dear readers! For in this brave new world of academia, where knowledge is power and power is about \u00a39,480 a year plus interest, we have visionaries like Tim Leunig to guide us. His proposal? A minimum \u00a310 weekly repayment for graduates. It's like a gym membership you never signed up for, but instead of sculpting your abs, you're toning your ability to live on baked beans and despair.\n\nAnd let's not overlook the cherry on top of this hallucinogenic sundae: Mandelson's suggestion to focus research on a \"smaller range of technologies.\" Because nothing says \"innovation\" quite like putting all your eggs in one basket, then juggling that basket while riding a unicycle on a tightrope over a pit of student debt.\n\nAs we stumble out of this acid trip of educational policy, one can't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia for the days when university was free and the biggest worry was whether to have chips or mash with your subsidized canteen lunch. But fear not, for in Mandelson's psychedelic paradise, the only limit is your imagination \u2013 and your credit score.\n\nSo raise a toast, dear students and academics, to the brave new world of higher education. May your degrees be ever valuable, your debts be ever manageable, and may you always remember: in the grand casino of life, the house always wins \u2013 and the house, in this case, wears a very expensive suit and answers to the name \"Lord Mandelson.\"",

The chandelier of knowledge flickers ominously as Lord Mandelson, resplendent in his ermine-trimmed robes and a jaunty mortarboard, takes center stage. With a flourish that would make Liberace look positively restrained, he unveils his grand plan: raise tuition fees! But wait, there's more! It's not just any raise \u2013 it's an inflation-linked raise. Be still, my beating student loan!\n\nAs I sit here, sipping my artisanal, fair-trade, organic coffee (because how else does one contemplate the machinations of the political elite?), I can't help but marvel at the sheer chutzpah of it all. It's as if Marie Antoinette, upon hearing that the peasants had no bread, suggested they try gluten-free croissants instead.\n\nBut fear not, dear reader, for Lord Mandelson assures us that this is all in the name of stability. Ah yes, the stability of knowing that your debt will grow as steadily as the ivy on those hallowed university walls. It's comforting, really, like the warm embrace of a straightjacket.\n\nAnd let's not forget the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of this fiscal fantasia: a new, progressive system of student loan repayments. It's so progressive, it's practically wearing Birkenstocks and composting its own receipts. Starting at a mere 2% of a graduate's income and increasing by 2 percentage points for each additional \u00a310,000 earned, it's a veritable Jacob's Ladder of debt repayment. One can almost hear the faint strains of \"Climb Every Mountain\" playing in the background as graduates ascend the career ladder, their wallets growing ever lighter with each rung.\n\nBut wait! There's a twist in this tale worthy of M. Night Shyamalan himself. This new system, we're told, will be particularly beneficial for women. Yes, ladies, rejoice! Your comparatively low salaries in crucial public service roles like nursing will now be met with the gentle caress of a slightly less punitive repayment scheme. It's feminism in action, folks \u2013 brought to you by the man who once mistook guacamole for mushy peas.\n\nAs I ponder this brave new world of higher education financing, I can't help but think of my own college days. Back then, my biggest financial worry was whether I could afford to supersize my ramen noodles. Now, it seems, students will be grappling with financial models more complex than the plot of \"Inception\" \u2013 all while trying to decipher the hidden meanings in \"Ulysses\" and master the art of beer pong.\n\nIn the end, one has to admire Lord Mandelson's optimism. It takes a special kind of visionary to look at a generation already drowning in debt and think, \"You know what they need? Water wings made of lead.\" But perhaps I'm being too cynical. After all, in the grand tradition of British higher education, from Oxbridge to the red-brick universities, we've always believed in throwing students in at the deep end. Now, thanks to Lord Mandelson, they'll have the added challenge of fiscal weights tied to their ankles.\n\nSo raise a glass (of the cheapest supermarket own-brand spirits, naturally) to the future of higher education in England. May your degrees be as valuable as the paper they're printed on, and may your debt be as eternal as the very concept of knowledge itself. Cheers, Lord Mandelson, and God save the student loan!",
